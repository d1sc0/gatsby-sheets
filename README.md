<h1>
Disco's Google Sheets
</h1>

This is an experiemnt made with Gatsby to explore building a simple static website that pulls content/or data from a google sheet and presents it to a user.

In testing this template I addtionally setup a script in the google sheet which would trigger build/deploy of the site when content was updated (using netlify webhook)
